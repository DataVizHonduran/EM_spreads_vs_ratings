## Data Sources

- **Credit Ratings**: Trading Economics sovereign ratings
- **Bond Data**: iShares ETF holdings (updated daily)

## Methodology

1. **Scrape** current sovereign credit ratings
2. **Load** ETF bond holdings and yields
3. **Merge** data by country
4. **Calculate** yield spreads vs rating peer averages
5. **Visualize** with interactive Plotly charts

## Interpretation

### Scatter Plot
Shows relationship between credit quality and bond yields. Higher ratings (lower numbers) typically have lower yields.

### Spread Chart
- **Negative spreads** (green): Country yields are lower than peers = trading "expensive"
- **Positive spreads** (red): Country yields are higher than peers = trading "cheap"

Cheap bonds may represent value opportunities or reflect country-specific risks not captured by ratings.
